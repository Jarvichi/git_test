## 🟠 Active Work

### Session 9 completions (2026-03-15)
- [x] **#175** Per-run escalating modifiers — ReplayModifier types, per-act counts, stacked HP%/interval/hand bonuses, crystalBonus, UI strip in NodePeekModal + battle HUD
- [x] **#174** Broken relic tracking — addBrokenRelic on break; notification shown on RelicSelectScreen; broken relics not shown in list (user preference)
- [x] **#187** CSS optimisation — CLAUDE.md rule, transitions standardised, action-btn--danger shared class, disabled states consolidated
- [x] **Text colour** — --game-text-color-dim/muted CSS vars; 51 hardcoded grays replaced with theme variables
- [x] **#179** Merchant Curiosity slot — probability 20%, price 10–20 crystals, "✦ CURIOSITY" label (was already implemented; tweaked params + label)

- [x] **Phase 7 / CLAUDE.md** Battle summary screen — implemented
- [x] **#173** Boss card mechanic (phase 2 fight after base falls) — implemented

- [x] **#192** Campaign events: HP bar on EventScreen — implemented

- [x] **Boss fight splash + HP fix**: `bossHpMultiplier` (default ×10) on phase-2 spawn; `⚡ BOSS FIGHT ⚡` overlay auto-dismisses after 2.5 s — implemented
- [x] **Relic break message**: relic icon + name shown on relic select screen when it shattered at act end — implemented
- [x] **#179** Merchant inventory item: 30% chance of 1 unowned item at 8 crystals alongside cards — implemented
- [x] **#171** Mystery node: 10% chance any normal battle node becomes a mystery encounter at runtime — `MysteryScreen.tsx`, lore text, `computeReward` reward, "Collect & Continue" — implemented



- [x] **#167** Settings Screen: overflow doesn't scroll on small devices — add `min-height: 0` to `.settings-body`
- [x] **#143** Campaign map: visited nodes full brightness + ✓ tick — already fixed
- [x] **#149** Campaign events: acts 2/3 reuse Act 1 text — already fixed
- [x] **#151** Title screen "Deck: X cards" label — already fixed
- [x] **#155** Inventory item pool + random rewards across all act events (see UX section)

---

## 🟡 UX / UI Bugs (session 6 — new)

- [x] **#183** Intro Screen: fade between "Awesome Software" and "A Jarv Creation" shows the title screen behind it — already fixed
- [x] **#189** Campaign intel: peek modal truncates enemy deck list with "+N more" — fixed; `playstyleDescription` now lists full deck
- [x] **#184** Settings: text size setting doesn't change anything — apply `zoom` to `.game-container` scaled by textSize/14; compensate height — needs manual close on GitHub
- [x] **#185** Settings: text colour setting doesn't change anything — fix circular CSS variable `--game-text-color: var(--game-text-color)` → `#33ff33` — needs manual close on GitHub
- [x] **#186** Achievements: add an indicator/badge on the achievements button on the title screen when there's an unclaimed reward — red `!` badge shown when any achievement is unlocked but unclaimed

---

## 🔴 Critical Bugs

- [x] **#97** Campaign: Act 2 event/shrine nodes launch a battle instead — fixed by user's "add events" commit (supply-cache/goblin-deal/wanderer/ambush-merchant added to events.json) — needs manual close on GitHub
- [x] **#53** Campaign soft-lock: `pendingNodeId` left set blocks map; blank screen at act end; validate/repair all localStorage on load
- [x] **#56** Campaign run-count text always says "fifth time" after run 5 — fix to use actual count
- [x] **Intro always says "tenth"** (no issue#) — runs 11–24 (and 26–49 etc.) still show milestone run text
- [x] **#90** Campaign events (shrine/ruins): result screen dismisses too fast — EventScreen already has CONTINUE button; already fixed — needs manual close on GitHub

---

## 🟠 Gameplay Bugs (new)

- [x] **#148** Cheating: refreshing during a battle resets it — already fixed
- [x] **#149** Campaign events: events in acts 2/3 reuse Act 1 text — already fixed

---

## 🟠 Gameplay Bugs

- [x] **#110** Points: winner could end up with fewer points than loser — fixed: winner gets +500 victory bonus in `checkGameOver` — needs manual close on GitHub
- [x] **#99** Obstacle avoidance: units give obstacles way too much clearance — reduce buffer zone around obstacle hitboxes (pushDist: obs.radius+55 → obs.radius+22)
- [x] **#86** Rewards screen: crystal amount not displayed — already fixed in PostBattleReward component (`+{crystals} ◆`) — needs manual close on GitHub
- [x] **#80** Difficulty scaling: each subsequent run reduces node handicap by 2 and raises opponent HP by 10 (via resolvedNodeOpts helper in App.tsx)

 - [x] **#63** Unit movement: units don't avoid obstacles properly (hitbox mismatch with SVG size) (closed on GitHub)
 - [x] **#62** Gameplay balance: Farm upgrade mana bug; structure cost vs unit cost balance (closed on GitHub)
- [x] **#87** Inventory: item detail modal when tapping a card; relics appear in inventory with icon, name, desc
- [x] **#88** Event rewards: shrines and watchtowers should occasionally give inventory/relic items (not just HP/crystals/cards)

---

## 🟡 UX / UI Bugs (new)

- [x] **#155** Inventory items: too many duplicate items granted — 423 items in `items.json`, unified `rewards.json`, weight-based `computeReward()` with dupe-skipping, daily login + all campaign events feed through same system; `gainItem` entries in all act event nodes draw from random pool
- [x] **#151** Title screen: "Deck: X cards" label is confusing — replace with a badge on Deck Builder button when unused cards exist; show "Collection X/Y" (unlocked/total) instead
- [x] **#143** Campaign map: visited nodes should render at full brightness with a solid fill and a ✓ tick overlay

---

## 🟡 UX / UI Bugs

 - [x] **#58** Screen size: battlefield + hand don't fit on small phone screens — scale to viewport (closed on GitHub)
- [x] **#65** Collection screen: Upgrade/Sell buttons always visible (greyed when unavailable), add text labels
- [x] **#46** UI consistency: title screen buttons same size; collection cards same size; victory screen buttons same size
- [x] **#109** Battery drain: game drains phone battery quickly — pause game loop when tab hidden; prefers-reduced-motion CSS
- [x] **#112** Buff cards UX: players can't tell if buff applies to current units or full battle duration — show status icons above buffed units and/or a HUD indicator for duration buffs

---

## 🟢 Enhancements — High Value

- [x] **#51** Daily login rewards: wire DailyLoginModal + InventoryScreen into App.tsx (files exist, not integrated)
- [x] **#57** Campaign shrines: hide expected rewards; randomise options; one option can be negative

 - [x] **#48** Deck builder filter labels: now use full words (Units, Structs, Upgrades, Common, Uncommon, Rare, Legendary, + TYPE/RARITY/SORT group labels) (closed on GitHub)
- [x] **#73** Campaign hack: page refresh now auto-resumes into the active battle (no title screen shown) — needs manual close
- [x] **#50** Sound: better battle music; death cries; crash sound for buildings (already implemented — needs manual close)
- [x] **#60** Rare event — The Gambler: tap-to-guess modal; win all cards or game reset; rubber chicken consolation; history tracking — needs manual close

---

- [x] **#150** Handle updates: auto-reload the PWA when a new version is deployed; show build ID in Settings → About — already fixed
- [x] **#146** Achievements: add "Campaign Failed" achievement; "100 Losses" and "1000 Losses" milestones
- [x] **#140** Act 4 achievements: no achievements currently fire for Act 4 completion — wire up the same hooks as Acts 1–3

- [ ] **#156** Hero card preview: title screen button → page showing all Hero Cards; tap opens card detail modal with lore
- [ ] **#158 / #157** Strengths & weaknesses: each unit gets 2 strengths and 2 weaknesses (e.g. Catapult weak to fire; Archer strong vs flying/slow, weak vs melee/fast); shown in card detail modal; applied as damage multipliers in engine (#157 is a duplicate of #158)
- [ ] **#159** Affinity system: units near same-type or paired units gain a buff or special ability (e.g. Archers near Archers → "Archer's Tempo" faster fire rate; Dragon flies over Catapult to protect it; Skeletons rally to Necromancer); design affinities for all units
- [ ] **#152** Endless mode: continuous waves — opponent dies, stronger one spawns; buildings limited to 3 rows; survive as long as possible; survival-time achievements

---

## ⚪ Features — Large / Long-term

 - [x] **#54** Intro screen: "Awesome Software Presents" logo → Jarv SVG → title (skip setting in settings) (closed on GitHub)

---

## 🔵 Enhancements — Architecture

---

## 🗺️ Acts System — Sub-issues from #144 (see docs/acts.md)

Sub-issues created for each unimplemented item from the closed #144. Reference `docs/acts.md` for full specs.

### Campaign Map
- [x] **#171** Mystery node — implemented (runtime 10% chance on any battle node)
- [x] **#172** Node peek modal — implemented

### Boss Mechanic
- [x] **#173** Boss card mechanic — implemented

### Campaign Structure
- [ ] **#180** Extend campaign to 25 acts (currently 4); plan and write acts 5–25 story, node maps, bosses, relics, hero cards, themed card sets
- [ ] **#181** Second 25-act story arc: after act 25 completes, a new 25-act arc begins in the same world with a new plot

### Replay System
- [x] **#175** Per-run modifiers — implemented
- [ ] **#144** Boss dialogue run-awareness: support substitution tags (`{n}`, `{ordinalLower}`) inside `bossDialogue` strings (currently plain text only)
- [ ] **#144** Global word substitution config: a separate JSON file (`web/src/data/wordVariants.json`) holding single-word alternate arrays usable as `{word:key}` tags in any act text

### Relics
- [x] **#174** Relic selection screen + breaking: 50% break chance on completion; broken relics removed from pool and become unique inventory items (broken-relics.json); re-earn by replaying the act

### Lives System
- [x] **#144** Add 3 lives to RunState (`livesRemaining`, `maxLives`); on battle loss player loses 1 life and can retry; at 0 lives show Campaign Failed screen (+50 crystals reward); lives reset to min 3 at act completion; relics/events can grant lives up to 9; shown in NodeMap HUD; "Nine Lives" achievement
- [x] **#144** Campaign Failed screen: 50 crystal reward, clear run, return to menu

### Cards
- [x] **#177** Add `lore` field to card schema — lore moved inline to each card/heroCard object in `cards.json`; `cards.ts` updated to read inline field
- [ ] **#178** Per-act themed card sets: at least 25 cards per act, tagged to that act's theme, earnable only in that act (except daily/crystal rewards)

### Music
- [x] **#144** Refactor sound.ts: export `MusicTrackConfig` type and `startMusicTrack`/`stopMusicTrack` generic API; named config objects (`BATTLE_MUSIC`, `TITLE_MUSIC`, `MAP_MUSIC`, etc.) passable to the engine; per-act wiring remains a future task
- [ ] **#176** Per-act music: add `mapMusic`, `battleMusic`, `bossMusic` fields to act JSON; wire to startMusicTrack calls — IN PROGRESS

### Merchant
- [x] **#179** Merchant rarely offers an inventory item alongside cards — implemented

---

## ✅ Done

- [x] Daily login reward system created (files only — integration pending above)
- [x] **#53** Campaign soft-lock fixed (pendingNodeId resume, run validation, actcomplete guard)
- [x] **#56** Campaign run-count ordinal text fixed (sixth/seventh/eighth/ninth)
